Solve challenge below. If anything is unclear use your own judgment to
make a reasonable assumption. Make sure you explain your assumption
and reasoning behind it.


1. Setup an application that works on Android and iOS, with a
navigation library and an example transition.


A. Build it (store as branch `part-1`).

B. Explain the reasoning behind the decision for the nav package you
use.


2. Create a github project browser using their public API which allows
filtering by tag and sorting by stars and name (spend 4 hrs. max., cut
features if you have to).


A. Estimate how long it will take you to complete the task.

B. Build a simplified version of it (by adding to the project from
challenge 1, as branch `part-2`).

C. Write a one-page high-level description of your solution. Answer:
   - what you've built
   - how it's tied together
   - your reasons for important decisions
   - how you would go about testing it (unit and UI level)


If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgment to make
assumptions (and explain them in section 2.C).
